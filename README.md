### 🎯 Object
The goal of this project is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. Those computer generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.

### 💻 How to Run

```bash
$ make
$ ./miniRT test.rt
```

> `.rt` samples are in `rt` folder.
